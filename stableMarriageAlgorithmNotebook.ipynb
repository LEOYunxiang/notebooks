    "Consider a set of $n > 0$ men and women who are interested in dating each other. Let us call the men $M_1, \\ldots, M_n$ and the women $W_1, \\ldots, W_n$. Each man expresses his preferences by ranking all the women from $1$ (most preferred date) to $n$ (least preferred date). Likewise, each woman ranks all the men from $1$ (her most preferred date) to $n$ (her least preferred date).\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example (Preference Matrices)__\n",
    "\n",
    "Consider three men $M_1, M_2, M_3$ and 3 woman $W_1, W_2, W_3$. The preference ordering for each man can be arranged in a matrix like thus:\n",
    "\n",
    "|  \t| $W_1$ \t| $W_2$ \t| $W_3$ \t|\n",
    "|-------\t|-------\t|-------\t|-------\t|\n",
    "| $M_1$ \t| 1 \t| 3 \t| 2 \t|\n",
    "| $M_2$ \t| 3 \t| 1 \t| 2 \t|\n",
    "| $M_3$ \t| 1 \t| 2 \t| 3 \t|\n",
    "\n",
    "The table above represents the rank ordering of preferences for each man. For instance, $M_1$ prefers $W_1$ the most, $W_3$ next and $W_2$ the least. \n",
    "\n",
    "Likewise, there is another table that represents the preferences of each woman. Here is an example matrix:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "|  \t| $M_1$ \t| $M_2$ \t| $M_3$ \t|\n",
    "|-------\t|-------\t|-------\t|-------\t|\n",
    "| $W_1$ \t| 3 \t| 1 \t| 2 \t|\n",
    "| $W_2$ \t| 3 \t| 1 \t| 2 \t|\n",
    "| $W_3$ \t| 3 \t| 2 \t| 1 \t|\n",
    "\n",
    "Note that now, women correspond to the rows of this table and men to the columns.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Definition (Matching)__\n",
    "\n",
    "A matching $F$ is a one-to-one correspondence from men $\\{ M_1, \\ldots, M_n \\}$ to women $\\{W_1, \\ldots, W_n\\}$ is an assignment of each man $M_j$ to a woman $F(M_j)$, such that \n",
    "\n",
    "- Each man $M_j$ is assigned to a unique woman $W_k:\\ F(M_j)$.\n",
    "- Each woman $W_k$ is assigned to a unique man $M_j:\\ F^{-1}(W_k)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* Recall from CSCI 2824, what a one-to-one correspondence between two sets is. \n",
    "\n",
    "> In the rather *playful* language of this problem, the term \"Marriage\" is used synonymously with the mathematical concept of a\n",
    "> \"Matching\". Finally, we note that it is equally fine to define a matching $F$ as an assignment from women to men. Because $F$ is a\n",
    "> one-to-one correspondence,  $F^{-1}$ exists and is a one-to-one correspondence as well.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example (Matching)__\n",
    "\n",
    "Going back to the example of $3$ men and women, consider the following matching:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $M_1$ is assigned $W_3$\n",
    "- $M_2$ is assigned $W_1$\n",
    "- $M_3$ is assigned $W_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can verify that this is indeed a one-to-one correspondence between the men and women. I will leave it as an exercise to provide a example of something that is not a matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond Dating!!\n",
    "---------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Contrary to what one imagines, the stable marriage problem is **not** about dating at all. It is in-fact a common theme in many situations:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Consider a situtation where there are $n$ programming job vacancies and $n$ candidates. Each vacancy may belong to a different company and call for different skills/responsibilities. The candidates have a ranked preferences for the vacancies, and likewise, the employers for each vacancy may have a ranked preference of candidates.\n",
    "- Every year, US medical students completing their degrees are matched to residency positions across the country for specialized medical training. \n",
    "\n",
    "Inefficiecies\n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "The standard approach to solving these assignment problem is often rather simple: every company with a job vacancy simply chooses its top candidate. This is a really bad since it leads to two issues:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Since every person can only have one job, there are unfilled positions or jobs without people.\n",
    "- Since the same person is often desirable for multiple jobs, there are people without job. \n",
    "\n",
    "Often this is resolved by multiple interview rounds, and multiple rounds of offers. \n",
    "\n",
    "*Therefore a matching is desirable*. It ensures that every man (or candidate, doctor in training) is mapped to a unique woman (or job, residency).\n",
    "\n",
    "Still, even if a matching is achieved, there remains the big problem of *instability*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Instability\n",
    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Instability is a common problem in these assignment problems. Imagine the following situation:\n",
    "\n",
    "- John is supposed to go on a date with Jane, and Mike on a date with Martha.  \n",
    "- However, John prefers Martha to Jane, and likewise, Martha prefers John to Mike. \n",
    "- In a completely rational (a.k.a. cold-hearted?) world, John and Martha will abandon their respective partners and go on a date with each other. As a result, Jane and Mike are left without dates.\n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of a situation is called an *instability*. Consider the following examples:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Marital instability as sometimes portrayed in certain movies/novels (eg., *Something Borrowed*? )\n",
    "- Jane currently holds a job with XYZ corporation. However, Jane really wants to  work for ABC corp. Also, ABC corporation prefers Jane to its current employee. Therefore, Jane leaves XYZ for ABC; and ABC fires its current employee to hire Jane. This causes some undesirable *churn*: people are fired, leave jobs, and jobs stay vacant. \n",
    "\n",
    "__Example (Instability)__\n",
    "Going back to our running example, it is clear that there is an *instability*. Consider $M_2$ and $W_2$.\n",
    "\n",
    "- $M_2$ prefers $W_2$ to his current assigned partner $W_1$.\n",
    "- $W_2$ prefers $M_2$ to her current assigned partner $M_3$.\n",
    "\n",
    "This is exactly the same situation as the ones described above.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we can define the desirable property of __stability__ for a matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Definition (Stable Matching)__\n",
    "\n",
    "A matching $F$ between the men and women, is said to be *stable* if  there is no pair $(M_i, W_j)$ where \n",
    "\n",
    "- $M_i$ is not assigned to $W_j$: $F(M_i) \\not= W_j$.\n",
    "- $M_i$ prefers $W_j$ to $F(M_i)$ (his current assigned partner).\n",
    "- $W_j$ prefers $M_i$ to $F^{-1}(W_j)$ (her current assigned partner).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Example (Stable Matching)__\n",
    "Now consider the following matching for the running example:\n",
    "\n",
    "- $M_1$ is matched to $W_3$,\n",
    "- $M_2$ is matched to $W_2$,\n",
    "- $M_3$ is matched to $W_1$.\n",
    "\n",

    "Deferred Acceptance Algorithm\n",
    "==============================\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "- It finds a stable matching for any *given any pattern of preferences for men/women*. \n",
    "- It is quite efficient: as we will see, its running time is $O(n^2)$ for $n$ men/women.\n",
    "\n",
    "Algorithm\n",
    "-----------\n",
    "\n",
    "The overall algorithm consists of many *rounds*. At the beginning of each round, we have a *partial matching* of some men to women. Also each mach maintains an ordered list of women that he has yet to propose to.\n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, at the start:\n",
    "\n",
    "- All men and women are unmatched. \n",
    "- The list for each man has all the women ordered according to the preference.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each round then proceeds to update the matching and the preference list for each man as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Each __unmatched__ man proposes to the first woman in his list, removing that woman from that list. A man that is currently matched does nothing during a round.\n",
    "2. After all the men have proposed, each woman collects at all the proposals she has received so far, including the man she is currently matched to. She selects her most preferred man from this set as her current matching.\n",
    "\n",
    "*Note:* It is possible for a woman to match with a man during round $i$ and abandon her current partner if a proposal from a more preferred partner comes along. This is why we call this a __deferred acceptance__ algorithm.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Termination__ The process terminates as soon as all the men are matched (and therefore all women have matched as well), or every man's list of women to propose to is empty."

    "> The process terminates as soon as all the men are matched (and therefore all women have matched as well), or every man's list of women to propose to is empty.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Theorem__ The deferred acceptance algorithm terminates for all possible inputs.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Proof__ We will do a proof by contradiction. Let us assume that there is an input ($n$, preference matrices for men/women) that runs forever without terminating. To derive a contradiction, we note the following at the start of any round:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each man has a list of women that he has not previously proposed to.\n",
    "- Since the process has not already terminated, there is at least one man $M_j$ who is unassigned.\n",
    "- As a result of this round, $M_j$ proposes to a woman and the size of his list reduces by 1.\n",

    "To summarize, if the process ran forever, at each step the size of the list for at least one man has to reduce by 1. But the lists are all of finite length and there are finitely many men/women. By Konig's theorem, there is at least one man whose list keeps reducing in size forever. \n",
    "\n",
    "But this is a contradiction, since the list would have become empty after finitely many steps and not reduced further.\n",

    "__Theorem__ Given a problem with $n$ men/women, the algorithm terminates within $n^2$ rounds.\n",

    "\n",
    "Correctness Proof\n",
    "-----------------\n",
    "\n",
    "We first prove that when the deferred acceptance algorithm terminates, it always does so with a matching. This means proving\n",

    "\n",
    "__Lemma__ If at any round $j$ of the algorithm, a woman $w$ has been matched, she will continue to remain matched (possibly to a different man) in the subsequent round.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Woman receives no fresh proposals and therefore, continues to remain matched to her current partner.\n",
    "2. Woman receives fresh proposals, and chooses the best man from all the proposals received including her currently matched partner.\n",

    "__Lemma__ At each round of the algorithm, each man is matched to *at most* one woman, and each woman to at most one man.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Proof__ This is proved easily induction.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Base Case__ At the start, no man or woman is matched. Therefore, the statement is trivially true.\n",

    "\n",
    "__Proof__ Let us assume for the sake of contradiction that the algorithm does terminate and at least one  man, \n",
    "say $m$, is unmatched. As a result,  since each man can be matched to at most one woman at any round, we conclude that there are as many unmatched women as men. Therefore, some woman, say $w$, is unmatched.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the algorithm terminated, it must have done so with the list of women that $m$ has yet to propose to as an empty list. In other words, $m$ must have proposed to all the women, including $w$. But since $w$ rejected $m$, she must have matched to someone else. But we proved that once a woman is matched at a round, she remains matched at all subsequent rounds. Therefore, $w$ cannot be unmatched.\n",

    "__Lemma__ If at the beginning of a round, a woman  $W_j$ is matched to her preference number $k$, then at the end of the round she is matched to a man with $k$ or smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "__Proof__ There are just two possibilities: the woman receives a proposal or not. If she does not, her preference for her partner remains the same. If she is, she selects the partner with the best preference (lowest preference number) from a list that includes her current matched partner. Therefore, the preference at the end of the round can only be smaller.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "__Theorem__ For all possible inputs, the deferred acceptance algorithm terminates with a *stable* matching.\n",

    "*Suppose the matching were unstable.* Let $M$ be a man and $W$ be a woman who cause instability. I.e, $M$ prefers $W$ to his current match and $W$ prefers $M$ to hers.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the deferred acceptance algorithm, each man goes down the list of his preferences during the algorithm. Therefore, we note that\n",
    "> $M$ must have proposed to $W$ at some point in the run of the algorithm.\n",

    "However, since $M$ did not end up with $W$ at the final result, it is easy to see that either\n",
